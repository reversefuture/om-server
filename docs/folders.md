# Folder structure
Below folders help organize and structure the application's logic and data flow. Here's a brief explanation of their functions and relationships:

**Routes**: The routes directory contains the **HTTP request handling logic**. It includes files that define the endpoints (URLs) and the corresponding HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that the application will respond to. Each route file typically exports a router object that is then mounted on the main application's router.

**Controllers**: The controllers directory contains the logic that **handles the business logic and data manipulation for each route**. Each controller file typically exports a class with methods that correspond to the HTTP methods defined in the route files. These methods handle the request, call the appropriate service or repository, and return the response.

**Services**: The services directory contains the logic that **interacts with the application's data layer**. Each service file typically exports a class with methods that perform specific data operations, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting data. Services often **use repositories to interact with the data layer**.

**Resolvers**: In some applications, the resolvers directory contains the logic that **handles data fetching and manipulation for a specific feature or module**. Resolvers are **often used in conjunction with GraphQL or similar data querying technologies**.

**Repositories**: The repositories directory contains the logic that **interacts with the application's data storage layer, such as a database or file system**. Each repository file typically exports a class with methods that perform specific data operations, such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting data. Repositories often **use data transfer objects (DTOs) to handle data transfer between the application and the data storage layer.**

**Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**: The dto directory contains the data structures that are used to **transfer data between the application's layers**. Each DTO file typically **exports a class that represents a specific data structure, such as a user**, product, or order. DTOs are often used in conjunction with repositories and services to handle data transfer between the application and the data storage layer.

**Entities**: The entities directory contains the **data structures that represent the application's data model**. Each entity file typically exports a class that represents a specific data entity, such as a user, product, or order. Entities are often used in conjunction with repositories and services to handle data manipulation and storage.

**Middlewares**: The middlewares directory contains the logic that **handles request processing and response formatting**. Each middleware file typically exports a function that performs a specific task, such as logging, authentication, or error handling. Middlewares are often used in conjunction with routes and controllers to handle request processing and response formatting.

In summary, the directories and their components work together to handle the application's request processing, data manipulation, and data storage. Each component has a specific role and interacts with the others to provide a cohesive and organized application structure.

## Data Transfer Objects (DTOs):

1.
Purpose: DTOs are used to transfer data between different layers of an application, such as between the client and server, or between different services within the application. They are designed to be lightweight and easy to serialize and deserialize.
2.
Structure: DTOs typically contain only the data fields that are necessary for the specific operation being performed. They do not contain any business logic or validation rules.
3.
Example: The provided code snippet defines two DTOs: CreateUserDto and UpdateUserDto. These DTOs are used to transfer user data between the client and server when creating or updating a user.


## Entities:
1.
Purpose: Entities represent the data model of an application and are used to store and manipulate data within the application. They are designed to be persistent and can be stored in a database or other data storage system.
2.
Structure: Entities typically contain all the data fields that are necessary for the specific data entity being represented. They may also contain business logic and validation rules to ensure data integrity and consistency.
3.
Example: The provided code snippet does not define any entities. However, an example of an entity might be a UserEntity class that represents a user in the application's data model. This entity might contain fields such as id, email, password, and role, as well as methods to perform operations such as createUser(), updateUser(), and deleteUser().
